### Hi there! 👋 I'm a Flutter Developer & Undergraduate Student

I am a mobile developer passionate about building scalable, maintainable applications. I don't just write code that works; I focus on **software architecture** and **robust state management**.

Currently, I am sharpening my skills by building complex applications using **Clean Architecture** and preparing for my graduation project.

### 🔭 What I'm Working On

**1. Offline Music Player (Current Flagship)**
A feature-rich local music player built to handle complex file queries and background audio tasks.
* **Tech:** Flutter, BLoC, `on_audio_query`, ObjectBox.
* **Focus:** Implementing a strict separation of concerns to manage local data and UI state efficiently.

**2. Graduation Project (Voclio)**
A smart productivity app that uses LLMs to transcribe voice input and intelligently categorize it into Notes or Actionable Tasks.
* **Core Logic:** Voice-to-text processing sent to an LLM for context parsing.
* **Integrations:** Google Calendar API for scheduling tasks directly from voice commands.
* **Tech:** Flutter, BLoC, External LLM APIs, Localization (i18n).
