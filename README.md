**Mobile Engineer · Flutter · Clean Architecture**

I build Android applications with an emphasis on maintainability and architectural correctness — feature-first clean architecture, strict layer separation, and domain-driven design using functional error handling. My work prioritizes structural decisions that scale, not just code that runs.

## Projects

### [Valoqui](https://github.com/fadyphil/Valoqui) — Real-Time AI Spanish Conversation Tutor

Real-time voice conversation partner for language learning. Eliminates wait times by running VAD and TTS fully on-device — one network roundtrip per exchange (LLM) rather than three. Built with AI agents under my architectural direction — see [JOURNEY.md](https://github.com/fadyphil/Valoqui/blob/main/JOURNEY.md).

**What's technically interesting:**

- **Segment-based VAD contract** — `SherpaVadDatasource` emits complete `Float32List` utterances after silence detection rather than raw bytes plus a separate boolean stream. Eliminates the timing correlation problem between two independent streams; STT receives exactly what VAD identified as speech.

- **Perceived latency optimization** — partial STT decoding begins while the user is still speaking. By the time silence is detected the final transcript arrives almost immediately rather than requiring a full decode pass post-speech. The actual decode time is identical; the perceived wait is not.

- **Sentence-boundary TTS trigger** — the BLoC detects `.`, `?`, `!` in the LLM token stream and fires TTS on the first complete sentence before the full response has arrived. Warm-up runs fire-and-forget during LLM generation so the engine is hot by the time the first boundary is hit.

- **Application-level echo cancellation** — VAD monitoring stops during TTS playback and restarts after, flushing internal buffers. Without this, Lucia's voice feeds back into the mic as a spurious VAD segment and drops the user's next utterance.

- **Lifecycle correctness under session cycling** — repositories registered as `registerFactory`, datasources as `registerLazySingleton`. Prevents the dead-singleton crash on second session when a route-scoped BLoC disposes a singleton on close. A registration type decision, not a code change.

### [Osserva](https://github.com/fadyphil/Music-App-Player) — Offline Music Player with Local Analytics

9 features, 221 files, 139 directories. The core idea: give users the listening analytics that streaming services provide, without routing any data off-device.

**What's technically interesting:**

- **Analytics data layer split into 4 distinct responsibilities** — `analytics_recorder` (write path), `analytics_reader` (query path), `analytics_aggregator` (rollup computation), and `audio_analytics_tracker` (session tracking). Separate datasource classes, not methods on a single class. 7 use cases sit above them including `watch_playback_history`, which exposes a reactive stream rather than a one-shot fetch.

- **Star schema SQLite analytics engine** — play events recorded against a fact table with dimension tables for songs, artists, albums, and genres. Daily rollups use a hot/cold record pattern to minimize write amplification on repeat plays.

- **Per-feature DI modules** — 8 dedicated `get_it` modules, each registering only its own dependencies. No monolithic init file; features are self-contained at the DI level.

- **Android Home Screen Widget** with full cold-start support — `OsWidgetManager` + `WidgetSyncService` handle state sync; playback can be initiated from the widget even when the app process is not running.

- **`fpdart` Either types** propagated through every repository and use-case boundary. Each feature defines its own typed failure classes (`AnalyticsFailure`, `ArtistFailure`, `PlaylistFailure`, etc.) rather than sharing a global failure type.

**Stack:** Flutter · BLoC · `sqflite` · `fpdart` · `freezed` · `get_it` · `auto_route` · `home_widget` · `just_audio` · `audio_service`

### [Git-RS](https://github.com/fadyphil/git-rs) — Git Object Engine in Rust
 
A from-scratch implementation of Git's core storage layer in Rust. Every object written by `git-rs` is verified readable by the official `git` binary — if the hashes match, the binary format is correct.
 
Implements: `init`, `hash-object`, `cat-file`, `write-tree`, `commit-tree`, `commit`.
 
**What's technically interesting:**
 
- **Hash-before-compress pipeline** — `write_object` constructs the `<type> <size>\0<content>` header, computes SHA-1 over the raw object, *then* Zlib-compresses for storage. The hash is a commitment to the content before any encoding — a single transposition and official `git` rejects the object entirely.
- **Content-addressed path derivation** — the filesystem path `.git/objects/XX/YYY...` is derived mathematically from the SHA-1 hash, not assigned. Two identical files produce one object on disk. Enforced by the storage layout, not application logic.
- **Size validation on read** — `read_object` parses the declared size from the object header and verifies it against the actual decompressed content length. Corruption is caught explicitly rather than propagating silently.
- **Post-order DAG traversal via call stack** — `write_tree` recurses into subdirectories before writing the parent entry. The recursion itself enforces the invariant that child hashes exist before a parent commits to them — no explicit queue or ordering logic required.
- **`Option<String>` for the initial commit** — `read_ref` returns `None` when the branch file doesn't yet exist, propagating cleanly into `write_commit_object` as `parent: None`. No special-casing at the call site.
- **Detached HEAD guard** — `read_head` explicitly rejects a raw hash in `.git/HEAD` with a meaningful error rather than silently treating it as a ref path.

### [Trip Planner](https://github.com/fadyphil/trip-planner) — Offline-First Travel Manager

Feature-first clean architecture applied to a multi-feature CRUD application. Offline-first by design using ObjectBox for persistence.

**Notable:** Budget estimation with live currency conversion using a cached-fallback strategy — the app degrades gracefully when the conversion API is unavailable, falling back to the last known rate.

**Stack:** Flutter · BLoC/Cubit · ObjectBox · Dio · `freezed` · `auto_route`

### Culinary Companion — Architectural Progression (v1 → v2)

Two sequential iterations of the same application, each targeting a specific architectural concern.

- **[v1](https://github.com/fadyphil/Edges-project-1):** BLoC pattern and computed state properties. `ExploreState` exposes derived getters (`todaysChallenge`, `filteredRecipes`) to keep the UI purely declarative.
- **[v2](https://github.com/fadyphil/Edges-project-1-api-integrated-v2-):** REST API integration with explicit repository-level error mapping — `DioException` is caught at the data layer and converted to typed `Failure` objects before crossing into the domain.

**Stack:** Flutter · BLoC · Dio · `freezed` · `auto_route` · `shared_preferences`
